# tex-tools

## assemble-latex.py

Assembles several TeX files in one. Recursively includes TeX files, substitutes BibTeX bibliography and strips the TeX comments (i.e., lines starting from "%"). This can be useful to do before submission of an article for publication.

Usage:
	assemble-latex.py main-tex-file output/dir
